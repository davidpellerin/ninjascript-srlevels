# ninjascript-srlevels

simple plugin to add Support and Resistance Levels to Ninja Trader 8 charts.

format is:

```
R5=$4019,R4=$4004,R3=$3993,R2=$3983+,R1=$3958,S1=$3940+,S2=$3931,S3=$3918,S4=$3900+,S5=$3891
```

make sure that your prices do not contain commas

if you add a + symbol to the price it will draw the line solid (to indicate that it is a stronger level)
